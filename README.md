# SeatCHK
A web app for fetching and displaying the number of reserved seats at Major Cineplex cinemas.

> [!WARNING]
> Major Cinplex's API can only retrieve showtimes for movies where tickets can still be purchased and can only be accessed from Thailand. Therefore it won't work on Vercel. Feel free to submit a pull request to edit the code if you find a workaround

This project is just me and Copilot learning how Vercel's serverless API works and how the frontend can interact with the backend. Just an experiment, not an actual product.
